   A. Foldername:    Experiment 1
      Short description:       Experiment 1 includes a simulated dataset with one explanatory variable. The dataset were split into a training dataset (800 subjects) and a test dataset (200 subjects).  The LBA-NN and LBA were implemented on the datasets to compare with each other quantitatively and qualitatively.


        
   B. Foldername:        Experiment 2
      Short description:        Experiment 2 includes a public LED dataset with five explanatory variables (https://www.openml.org/d/40496). The dataset were split into a training dataset (500 subjects) and a test dataset (100 subjects). LBA-NN and LBA were implemented on the datasets to compare with each other quantitatively and qualitatively.


        
   C. Foldername:    Experiment 3    
      Short description:	Experiment 3 includes a previously used German Suicide data with two explanatory variables (Van der Heijden, Mooijaart, and De Leeuw 1992). The dataset were split into a training dataset (43211 subjects) and a test dataset (10000 subjects). LBA-NN and LBA were implemented on the datasets to compare with each other quantitatively and qualitatively.
